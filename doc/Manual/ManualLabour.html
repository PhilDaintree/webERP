<h2><a id="Employees">Setting Up Employees</h2>
<p>Labour in webERP is actually a special type of item - this allows the routings to be defined in the bill of materials along with all the other physical components. This requires that each employee have an associated labour type item which is previously defined in stock/item master. Labour items are simply stock items that have a stock category that is a labour type. Child items of labour type stock categories are all labour items.</p>
